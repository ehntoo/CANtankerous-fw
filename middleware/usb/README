This directory was originally sourced from the MCUXpresso SDK, release 2.10.1.
This is what I could find regarding licensing:

```
usb                        Name: USB                                         
                           Version: 2.8.0                                    
                           Outgoing License: BSD-3-Clause                    
                           License File: COPYING-BSD-3                       
                           Format: source code                               
                           Description: NXP USB stack. This is a version of  
                           the USB stack that has been integrated with the   
                           MCUXpresso SDK.                                   
                           Location: middleware/usb                          
                           Origin: NXP (BSD-3-Clause)                        
```

I am accordingly reproducing the 3-Clause BSD license included with the
original SDK and using the stack under those terms.
